## Submission notes

This is the first CRAN submission of this package.

The package provides nested sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for performing
sequential inference in the Bayesian Mallows model. The implementation is based
on the methodology described in Sørensen (2025) <doi:10.1214/25-BA1564>.
