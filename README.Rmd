BayesMallowsSMC2 provides functions for performing sequential inference in the Bayesian Mallows model using the SMC$^{2}$ algorithm. The package implements the methods described in @sorensen2025sequential.

The Bayesian Mallows model is a probabilistic framework for analyzing ranking data, and this package extends it to handle sequential learning scenarios where rankings arrive over time. The SMC$^{2}$ (Sequential Monte Carlo squared) algorithm enables efficient Bayesian inference by combining particle filtering with MCMC methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BayesMallowsSMC2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("osorensen/BayesMallowsSMC2")
```

## Usage

This package implements sequential Bayesian inference for ranking data using the Mallows model. The main function is `compute_sequentially()`, which performs SMC$^{2}$ inference as rankings arrive over time.

```r
library(BayesMallowsSMC2)

# Example usage (see vignettes for detailed examples)
# result <- compute_sequentially(data, hyperparameters, smc_options)
```
