Description: Provides nested sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for performing
    sequential inference in the Bayesian Mallows model, which is a widely used
    probability model for rank and preference data. The package implements the
    SMC2 (Sequential Monte Carlo Squared) algorithm for handling sequentially
    arriving rankings and pairwise preferences, including support for complete
    rankings, partial rankings, and pairwise comparisons. The methods are based
    on Sørensen (2025) <doi:10.1214/25-BA1564>.
